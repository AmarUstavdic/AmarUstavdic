- 🔍 Passionate about competitive programming, algorithms, and data structures.
- 🚀 Love experimenting and pushing my boundaries to discover new things.
- 💡 Believe in the power of hands-on learning and continuous improvement.
- 💻 Linux enthusiast using it as my daily driver.

## 🚀 Skills & Interests
- **Languages:** Java, Python, C++, C, Bash, JavaScript
- **Technologies:** Git, Docker (somewhat knowledge)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Operating System:** Linux (daily driver)
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Strong understanding and constant improvement.
- **Ongoing Learning:** Exploring Neural Networks and Blockchain.

## 💡 Competitive Programming
In my free time, I sharpen my problem-solving skills on platforms like Codeforces, HackerRank, and LeetCode. Here, I tackle various challenges, participate in contests, and strive to improve my ranking.

## 🔭 Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on or have completed:
### [P2P Authoritative Multiplayer Game Architecture](https://github.com/AmarUstavdic/P2P-Authoritative-Multiplayer-Game-Architecture)

This project originated as a part of a faculty course on multithreaded programming, evolving into a captivating exploration of peer-to-peer (P2P) authoritative multiplayer game architecture. 
While it's still a work in progress, the journey has been nothing short of enlightening.

#### Key Learnings:
- **Multithreaded Programming:** Delved into the intricacies of managing concurrent threads, a crucial aspect of robust multiplayer game development.
- **Kademlia DHT:** Gained a profound understanding of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), with a specific focus on Kademlia, a fundamental component for decentralized peer discovery.  
- **Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs):** Explored the concept of VDFs and their application in building trustless systems.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Scratched the surface of blockchain technology, a realm I'm currently navigating for this project. Understanding how it fits into the broader architecture and exploring its potential applications.

#### Future Plans:
With a solid foundation laid, the project is slated to continue as a part of my diploma work.
Feel free to explore the project repository and share your insights or suggestions! 🚀
